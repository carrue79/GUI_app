# GUI_app

This is a simple Graphical User Interface(GUI) project for batch processing multiple files. If you will run this code, there will open little window, where located some buttons to select file, open it and then edit this file. The main idea of this project is changing images by cropping them to instagram resolution and the color of the image to black and white. It's kind of photo redactor.
